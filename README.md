# TrackTrainee-Hub
TrackTrainee-Hub is designed to demonstrate the implementation of a full-stack CRUD-based trainee management system. This solution showcases clean architecture, API integration, and the use of Blazor for building modern web applications.

## Overview
This solution is composed of three core projects:

1. **Blazor Project**  
   - A modern client-side web application built using Blazor.
   - Performs all CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) by interacting with the API.

2. **Services (API)**  
   - A backend project responsible for providing a RESTful API.
   - Handles business logic, data storage, and communication with the database.
   - Acts as the central hub connecting the Blazor frontend with the Shared Library.

3. **Shared Library**  
   - Contains shared models, DTOs (Data Transfer Objects), and utilities.
   - Ensures consistency and reusability across the solution.
   - Facilitates seamless communication between the Blazor frontend and the backend API.

## Technologies Used
- **C#**
- **ASP.NET Core APIs**
- **Entit Framework**
- **Blazor**
